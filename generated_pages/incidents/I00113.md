# Incident I00113: Inside the Shadowy World of Disinformation for Hire in Kenya

* **Summary:** <i>This research examines how Kenyan journalists, judges, and other members of civil society are facing coordinated disinformation and harassment campaigns on Twitter — and that Twitter is doing very little to stop it. The research provides a grim window into the booming and shadowy industry of Twitter influencers for political hire here in Kenya. <br><br>We conducted the research over the course of three months using tools like Sprinklr, Gephi and Trendinalia. We also interviewed influencers who participated in the campaigns, and collected a vast trove of screenshots, memes, and other evidence. In total, our research uncovered at least nine different disinformation campaigns consisting of over 23,000 tweets and 3,700 participating accounts.</i>

One influencer we spoke to mentioned that the people who own coveted “blue check” accounts will often rent them out for disinformation campaigns.

Simply looking at their date of creation won’t give you a hint as to their purpose. We had to dig deeper. The profile pictures and content of some of the accounts gave us the answers we were looking for. A common tactic these accounts utilize is using suggestive pictures of women to bait men into following them, or at least pay attention. In terms of content, many of these accounts tweeted off the same hashtags for days on end and will constantly retweet a specific set of accounts.</i><br><br>Actors participating in this operation rented out verified Twitter accounts (in 2021 a checkmark on Twitter verified a user’s identity), which were repurposed and used updated account imagery (T0146.003: Verified Account Asset, T0150.007: Rented Asset, T0150.004: Repurposed Asset, T00145.006: Attractive Person Account Imagery). |

Each campaign execution involves tweeting about the hashtags of the day until it appears on the trending section of Twitter.
