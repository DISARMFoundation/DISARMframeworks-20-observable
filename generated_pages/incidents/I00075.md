# Incident I00075: How Russia Meddles Abroad for Profit: Cash, Trolls and a Cult Leader

* **Summary:** <i>“It was one of Russia’s most overt attempts at election interference to date. Working from their headquarters in a resort hotel, the Russians published their own newspaper in the local language and hired students to write fawning articles about the president to help him win another term. Skirting electoral laws, they bought airtime on television stations and blanketed the country with billboards.<br><br> “They paid young people to attend rallies and journalists to cover them. They showed up with armed bodyguards at campaign offices to bribe challengers to drop out of the race to clear their candidate’s path.<br><br> “At Madagascar’s election commission, officials were alarmed.”</I>
