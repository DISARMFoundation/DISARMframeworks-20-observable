| [I00130 Deepfake Pornography Goes to Washington: Measuring the Prevalence of AI-Generated Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery Targeting Congress](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00130.md) | <i>The American Sunlight Project (ASP) has identified tens of thousands of hits for AI-generated Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery (NCII) depicting more than two dozen Senators and Members of Congress </i><b>(T00XX.0XX: Deepfake Impersonation, T0176.007: Sexually Explicit Content, T0097.111: Government Official Persona),<i></b> an overwhelming majority of whom are women. In conducting this first-of-is-kind study, ASP aimed to understand the extent to which federal elected officials are affected by the recent explosion in accessible generative AI technologies that has led to a proliferation of deepfake pornography.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The ASP research team identified 35,545 hits matching the names of 26 Senators and Members of Congress on eleven websites known for spreading AI-generated NCII. From these hits, ASP identified tens of thousands of images and videos depicting 26 Senators and Members of Congress, including 25 women, nearly 16 percent of all female Members of the 118th Congress. Only one male Member (less than one percent of male Members of the 118th Congress) was identified in NCII. These findings emphasize the stark gender disparity; women Members are 70 times more likely to appear in NCII content than male Members.</i> |
